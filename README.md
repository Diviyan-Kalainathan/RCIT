# RCIT and RCoT
This is an R package implementing the Randomized Conditional Independence Test (RCIT) and the Randomized conditional Correlation Test (RCoT). As a general rule, RCoT is superior to RCIT for conditional independence testing.

# Installation

The package depends on the MASS and momentchi2 packages on CRAN, so please install these first. Then:

> library(devtools)

> install_github("Diviyan-Kalainathan/RCIT")

> library(RCIT)

> RCIT(rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000))

> RCoT(rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000))
